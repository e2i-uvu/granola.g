# How to

The `app.py` is the *parent* of the rest of the streamlit pages.

It acts as the entrypoint or router to send traffic to all other pages.

There is a bunch of code that defines:

* Styles
* Titles
* Menus
* Other stuff for whole app

## New Pages

To add or edit pages, just look at `st.navigation` inside the `app.py`
