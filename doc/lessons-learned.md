# Lessons Learned

- It is important to lay out the entire plan of the project and clarify what we are going to do. We need to run it by People and Culture because they may have rules and regulations about what is acceptable.
  
- We need to review all requirements and measure them against the rules and company standards.

- Each project needs a mission statement that is communicated to all team members. If team members canâ€™t see the "why," the project may lose focus.

- Start each project with ground rules, including guidelines for honesty, collaboration, communication, and so on.

- Changes in scope without proper documentation can be problematic. We need to help stakeholders understand how much it will benefit the team to have well-documented scope change requests.

- Team meetings should hold everyone accountable.

- Implement a strict change control process for stakeholders to follow.
