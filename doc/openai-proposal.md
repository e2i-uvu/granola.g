**Proposal for OpenAI Billing Account**

**Project:** Granola.g

**Date:**

**Author**: Noble Beazel

**Purpose**

This proposal aims to establish an OpenAI billing account within our
department for the Granola.g project. The OpenAI services will play a
crucial role in enhancing our project's AI capabilities, particularly in
building and optimizing teams for various tasks.

**Estimated Monthly Costs**

**GPT4-o** : \$5 per 1 million input, \$15 per 1 million output

**Usage Costs:** \$10-\$50 per month

**Justification**

**Why We Need OpenAI**

1\. AI Capabilities: OpenAI will enable advanced AI-driven
functionalities, such as team-building algorithms, chat interfaces, and
automated decision-making processes.

2\. Efficiency Improvements: Integrating OpenAI will significantly
reduce the time spent on manual team-building tasks, allowing us to
allocate resources more efficiently.

3\. Innovation: Utilizing cutting-edge AI technology will enhance our
project\'s innovation and competitive edge.

**Project Integration**

-   Team Building Algorithm: The OpenAI API will be used to develop an
    AI-driven algorithm that matches team members based on their skills,
    preferences, and project requirements.

-   AI Chat Interface: OpenAI will power an AI chat interface to
    facilitate interaction between users and the team-building system.

-   Automated Decision-Making: OpenAI will enable the system to make
    data-driven decisions, improving accuracy and effectiveness.

**Usage and Requirements**

**Who Will Use It**

-   Development Team: Primary users responsible for integrating OpenAI
    services into the project. This includes backend and frontend
    developers.

-   Project Managers: Overseeing the implementation and ensuring that
    the AI functionalities align with project goals.

-   Team Builders/Admins: Utilizing the AI tools to form and manage
    teams effectively.

**Technical Requirements**

-   API Integration: Access to OpenAI API keys and documentation.

-   Security Measures: Implementing necessary security protocols to
    ensure data privacy and compliance with FERPA laws.

-   VM Setup: Virtual machine setup for development and testing
    purposes.

**Fit with Project Objectives**

The integration of OpenAI is aligned with the core objectives of the
Granola.g project:

-   Objective: Lessen the load on Management of E2i for hiring and
    placing employees on different teams for projects within the
    organization.

-   OpenAI Contribution: AI-driven team-building algorithm to streamline
    hiring and placement processes.

-   Objective: Decrease time spent on organizing teams, interviews, and
    selecting appropriate candidates.

-   OpenAI Contribution: Automating these processes using AI chat
    interfaces and decision-making algorithms.

**Conclusion**

Establishing an OpenAI billing account is essential for the successful
execution and innovation of the Granola.g project. The AI capabilities
provided by OpenAI will enhance efficiency, reduce manual workload, and
drive the project towards achieving its objectives. The estimated costs
are justified by the significant benefits and advancements that OpenAI
will bring to our project.
